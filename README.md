An improved version of the iCubeSmart 3D8 software to control 3D*8 monochrome or multicolor LEDs cube

- **File import/export**
  - Added support for `.xml` files in addition to the legacy `.gpro8` format
  - Enables easier integration with external tools and workflows

- **Code refactoring & translation fixes**
  - Class structure updated for clarity and maintainability
  - Corrected naming inconsistencies caused by Chinese â†” English translation issues

## Tech Notes

- Developed in **C# / .NET Framework (Windows Forms)**
- Uses **DirectX** for 3D rendering
- Tested on **Windows 7** and **Windows 11**
